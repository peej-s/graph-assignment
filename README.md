# graph-assignment

As part of a code assessment, this solution allows us to visualize a group of cities (connected by one-way train routes) and make some calculations accordingly.

This solution can tell you:
- The distance of the route of sequence of cities
- The number of routes from a starting city to an ending city, with up to or equal to a set number of stops
- The length of the shortest route from a starting city to an ending city (calculated using dijkstra's algorithm)
- The number of different routes from a starting city to an ending city, with an upper limit on the total distance
